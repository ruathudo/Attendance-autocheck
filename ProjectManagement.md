#### Project management and self reflection
The time for doing this project was quite tight in our group's perspective. However, we tried our best to accomplish to project. 
In general, the project at some points was more into theories which sometimes lead us to an theorical overload. It would be much 
more easier to understand new kind of concepts if there are real cases to practise on. Nevertheless, we learnt how to structure
a software requirements from scratch as well as how work-flow goes. Back to the project, we are happy and satisfied with what we
have done so far. Group members working so hard and contribute a large amount of time to the project. In particular, each member
probably worked individually approximately 20 hours and between 6-8 hours together. Althought many hours were spent for the project
there are still some parts need to be clarified in more detailed. Therefore, on the following project we will know how to do more
efficiently.
