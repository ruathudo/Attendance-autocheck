I. Introduction about project.

Everyday, our teacher come to class, have a feeling depressed when so many students have a truant. To ensure enough knowledge, student must attend enough. He tried to check attendance by paper, but some smart guys come sign the name in paper then leave, someone ask their friend check for them. Teacher asked us make an application to solve this problem. So, we have an idea for that. Auto check attendance is the solution. That is an application which students installed in smartphone, using indoor positioning technology in order to check where student is and how long he attended. A short description, students will bring their phone with app installed to the class. Application will auto check attendance for theme and send the information to the teacher. Teacher will have a summary about the class as well as the whole course. It is so useful to prevent the lazy student and decrease work for teacher. This application will be compatible with so many platform, secure, and friendly for everyone.
